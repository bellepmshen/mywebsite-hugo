**Hi, I'm Belle!**

I'm currently living in southern California!

I used to work in manufacturing sector. Part of my responsibility was to analyze large amount of manufacuring data in order to find the failure modes to improve yields. I used DoE (Design of Experiment), 8D (Eight Disciplines of Problem Solving) and FMEA (Failure Mode & Effects Analysis) to improve manufacturing problems to let my clients projects move forward to production phase.

In my graduate school experiences, I wrote IDL codes to analyze stellar spectroscopy to investigate stellar evolutionary model by using Fourier Transform & Gaussian fitting.

<!-- **Why I choose data science as my future career?**

In my project manager journey, I found out I loved the sense of achievements when I figured out what was the root cause behind the failure modes by analyzing large amount of data and I always love coding, especially you can write codes to do data analysis and then, you interpret the results, you find something, you provide your solutions to your clients!

Thus, these experiences draw me to data science, so that's why I joined a data science bootcamp and the more I devote myself into this field, the more I find out it is so interesting! -->
