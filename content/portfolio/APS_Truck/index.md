<!-- This would be a description of your sample project. You can add any content you'd like. -->

The purpose of this prediction model is to establish a unified method to assist in loan officersâ€™ evaluation, incorporating a wide variety of data often overlooked. The prediction model will allow officers to process 2x to 3x the amount of applications with high degree of confidence, or free up their time to evaluate more complicated (potentially higher margin) cases while letting the model automatically approve the obvious prime applicants. The overall default exposure of the company can thus be controlled yet systematically and confidently managed to lower overtime.
